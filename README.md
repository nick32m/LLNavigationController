LLNavigationController
======================

A custom navigation controller


Why do we want custom navigation controller?

We can define the navigation bar height. In normal UINavigationController, the navigation bar is fixed with 44 pixels height. But sometimes we want to have a higher navigation bar to present more information or fit the styles from designer
